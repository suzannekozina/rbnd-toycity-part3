**How long did you spend working on this project?**
In all I spent 10 hours working on this project. I spent roughly 5 hours on research and 5 hours on working with the actual code
in the project.  I used checklists from the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming) to help make sure I was
understanding concepts properly and implementing them with Ruby that is clean and understandable to me.

**What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?**
It was very exciting for me to gain fluency with Git and Github. A while a go I had tried using Github Desktop to fork and clone,
but I didn’t really get it working properly.  With this project not only was I able to get my push my local files back to my github
repository, but I was also able to set up an SSH agent and push changes fluidly. This was so very rewarding!

**What two additional features did you build? Why?**
I built three additional features.
1. Invalid Input Error - I work with content management databases and have lived the nightmare of cleaning up data that was entered by
multiple users into databases without any invalid data input errors to prevent the proliferation of error-filled data. Keeping data input
clean and consistent is something I really value. I would like to explore more ways to accomplish that in future Ruby projects.  For
now I used the  #is_a? method to accomplish some basic invalid input error goals. This method was a new find for me and I enjoyed
experimenting it.

2. Time of Transaction - I added a timestamp to the transaction class because I often find timestamps are helpful in record-keeping and
content management.

3. Associating transactions with a given product - This is to track how many transactions a product has. 

**Where do you still have room to grow?**
I still have so much to learn. I am very aware of that. I need much more practice writing code. There’s so much more to learn, it’s kind
of overwhelming. I am really glad to have the structure of the Ruby Nanodegree to help focus my effort. I think I could have spent
8 weeks just trying out all the different ways to use Ruby public methods, blocks, and loops.  The realization that I am already starting some
Object Oriented Programing and defining my own classes is very excited to me. I guess the answer to the question “Where do you still have
room to grow?” is EVERYWHERE! ;)
